# Python distribution used in CBIG

The Python distribution used in CBIG is based on [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). We use [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) to manage Python packages, especially for packages that rely on external dependencies (e.g. Numpy). We use Python 3.6 in our lab.

# Neuroimaging and Machine Learning Packages

Defined in `CBIG_python3_env.yml`

-   [numpy](https://numpy.org/) version 1.19.5
-   [scipy](https://scipy.org/) version 1.5.4
-   [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) version 0.24.2
-   [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) version 0.0.11
-   [torch](https://pytorch.org/) version 1.9.0

# Quick Installation (for Linux)

Before installing, please check if you have a `.condarc` file in your home directory. This is an optional configuration file of Conda that you might have (not a default configuration file installed by Conda). If so, please back up and rename this file before installing, e.g. `mv ~/.condarc ~/.condarc_bak`.

To install the `CBIG_py3` environment, we provide a quick installation script under $CBIG_CODE_DIR/setup/python_env_setup. A common cause for errors when installing the CBIG_py3 environment is an outdated conda version. Please ensure that the conda version is equivalent to `4.10` or later. You can use `conda update conda` to update your conda to latest version.
If the `CBIG_py3` environment already exists, it will be renamed to `CBIG_py3_bak`as a backup.

To run the quick installation, open a terminal, switch to this directory and run following command:

```
cd $CBIG_CODE_DIR/setup/python_env_setup
bash CBIG_python_env_generic_setup.sh
```

**[IMPORTANT]** To test if the setup is successful, **log out and log in again** before running:

```bash
source activate CBIG_py3
python -m pytest $CBIG_CODE_DIR/setup/python_env_setup/tests/CBIG_python_env_setup_unit_test.py
```

When `CBIG_python_env_setup_unit_test.py` is successful, you should see a message similar to :

```
================== 8 passed in 18.28s ==================
```

# Install other packages for your own needs

The default packages installed with `CBIG_python_env_generic_setup.sh` are meant to maintain a common Python environment for users of the CBIG repo.

If you wish to install other packages for your own test/usage, you are **highly recommended** to create a new conda environment and install packages under your own conda environment.
See our guide for [installing a package with conda](https://github.com/YeoPrivateLab/CBIG_private/tree/develop/setup/python_env_setup#install-a-certain-package).

If you deem the package to be useful for whole lab, please contact the admins so that we can have the package installed by default.

# Switch between conda environments

You can switch between CBIG's Python 3 environment and your own environment by the command `source activate <Your_Environment>`.

```bash
username@yourpc:~> source activate <Your_Environment>
(<Your_Environment>) username@yourpc:~>
(<Your_Environment>) username@yourpc:~> python my_python3_script.py
(<Your_Environment>) username@yourpc:~>
(<Your_Environment>) username@yourpc:~> source activate CBIG_py3
(CBIG_py3) username@yourpc:~> python my_python_3_script.py
(CBIG_py3) username@yourpc:~>
(CBIG_py3) username@yourpc:~> source deactivate
username@yourpc:~>
```

# Conda crash course

Also see the official [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) documentation for details.

### List information of all available packages

```bash
username@userpc:~> conda list
```

### Get information of a certain package

```bash
username@userpc:~> conda list numpy
```

### Search for available versions of a certain package

```bash
username@userpc:~> conda search numpy
```

### Install a certain package

If no version number is given, conda will automatically install the latest version

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda install numpy=1.21.2
```

If conda could not find the package (e.g. [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed in CBIG_py3), you could try [pip](https://pypi.org/) to install the package.

```bash
username@yourpc:~> pip install tedana=0.0.11
```

### Update a certain package

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda update numpy
```

### Update all packages

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda update --all
```

### Create another conda environment

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda create --name whatever_name what_software
```

#### Example

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda create --name fancyname python=3.6
```

### Export conda environment

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda env export --name your_env_name >  your_env_name_config.yml
```

### Create an identical conda environment from config file

```bash
username@yourpc:~> conda env create --file env_config.yml
```
