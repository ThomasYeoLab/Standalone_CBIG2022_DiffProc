Deck is a Matlab toolbox which currently contains:

 - a general utility module called `dk`;
 - a data-analysis module called `ant`;
 - a C++/Mex library `jmx`.

It was written for Linux/OSX, but may work on Windows for certain applications. It should work with all Matlab versions above 2015a, although MathWorks like to introduce version-breaking changes in their releases, so if you find a bug please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/jhadida/deck/issues).

The list of contributors can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/jhadida/deck/-/graphs/master).
