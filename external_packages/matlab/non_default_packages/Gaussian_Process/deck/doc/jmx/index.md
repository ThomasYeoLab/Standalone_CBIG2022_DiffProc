# Mex library

JMX is a lightweight C++ library which greatly simplifies working with Mex files in Matlab.

It is used in the Mex functions implemented in the [Ant package](ant/index) for instance, which can be compiled by calling `ant.compile()` from the Matlab console.
The sources are located in folder `jmx/`, which is added to the path when calling `dk_startup()`.
