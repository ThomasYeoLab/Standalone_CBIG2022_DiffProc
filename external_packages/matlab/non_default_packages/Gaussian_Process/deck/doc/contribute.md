This is an open-source and free software project, and all PRs are welcome:

 - If you find a bug or report an issue, take a minute to suggest a fix if you can, this is always greatly appreciated;
 - Formal testing allows you to ensure a consistent behaviour across versions for the functions you use in this toolbox, contributing unit-tests is in everyone's best interest;
 - If you think something is missing, outdated or unclear in the documentation, feel free to submit a PR with your proposed changes;
 - If you think the Deck library would benefit from an additional function in one of the submodules, explaining your train of thought when opening a PR can only increase your chances for acceptance.
