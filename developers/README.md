This folder contains workspace for individual investigators.
Feel free to create your own personal folders within this folder, e.g. `developers/gia` if you want to use CBIG's git version control for your code.

Note that this folder will not be released to the public repository.
Once you feel your code is ready to be released to the public (e.g. source code of your published paper), you can move your polished code to `stable_projects`.
Please check with the admins of the repo and Thomas if you need to release your code to the public.
