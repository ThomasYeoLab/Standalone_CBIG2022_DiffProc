Diffusion processing project depends on real diffusion MRI data, but these data are too large to be released in our GitHub repository. Therefore, we do not provide examples to run the scripts of this project.

However, there are example scripts that verify the accuracy of our `unit_tests` that you can use for your reference. Note that the `unit_tests` example can only run within CBIG lab.
