This folder contains workspace for collaborative projects that are still under development.

You can also create your own folder under `developer` to host your individual project's code.
Note that this folder will not be released to the public repository.
Once you feel your code is ready to be released to the public (e.g. source code of your published paper), you can move your polished code to `stable_projects`.
Please check with the admins of the repo and Thomas if you need to release your code to the public.
